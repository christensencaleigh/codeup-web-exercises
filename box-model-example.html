       <p>“One, remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet.
           Two, never give up work. Work gives you meaning and purpose and life
           is empty without it. Three, if you are lucky enough to find love,
           remember it is there and don't throw it away.”</p>

    <div id="section-two"></div>
       <p>“For millions of years, mankind lived just like the animals.
           Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination.
           We learned to talk and we learned to listen. Speech has allowed the
           communication of ideas, enabling human beings to work together to build
           the impossible. Mankind's greatest achievements have come about by
           talking, and its greatest failures by not talking. It doesn't have
           to be like this. Our greatest hopes could become reality in the future.
           With the technology at our disposal, the possibilities are unbounded.
           All we need to do is make sure we keep talking.</p>
    <div id="section-three"></div>
        <p>“The victim should have the right to end his life, if he wants.
            But I think it would be a great mistake. However bad life may
            seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at.
            While there's life, there is hope.”</p>
    <div id="section-four"></div>
       <p>“We are in danger of destroying ourselves by our greed and stupidity.
           We cannot remain looking inwards at ourselves on a small and increasingly
           polluted and overcrowded planet.”</p>
    <div id="section-five"></div>
        <p>“The future is unknown and open, so it might well have the curvature required.
            This would mean that any time travel would be confined to the future.
            There would be no chance of Captain Kirk and the Starship Enterprise
            turning up at the present time.”</p>
